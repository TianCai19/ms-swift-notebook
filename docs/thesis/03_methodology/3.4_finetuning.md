# 3.4 Fine-tuning Strategy

## 3.4.1 Overview of Fine-tuning Approach

Fine-tuning represents a critical phase in adapting pre-trained language models to specific domains and tasks. In the context of psychological counseling applications, fine-tuning enables models to acquire domain-specific knowledge, improve response quality, and enhance their ability to engage in therapeutic conversations. Our fine-tuning strategy is designed to balance computational efficiency with performance optimization, ensuring that the adapted models can effectively serve real-world psychological counseling scenarios.

The fine-tuning process involves several key components: (1) **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)** using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), (2) **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)** with carefully curated psychological counseling datasets, (3) **Hyperparameter optimization** for optimal performance, and (4) **Evaluation and validation** to ensure quality and safety.

## 3.4.2 Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning with LoRA

### 3.4.2.1 LoRA Architecture and Implementation

**Core Principles of LoRA**
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements while maintaining or improving model performance. The fundamental idea behind LoRA is to decompose the weight updates during fine-tuning into low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters.

**Mathematical Foundation**
For a pre-trained weight matrix W₀ ∈ ℝ^(d×k), LoRA parameterizes its change during fine-tuning as:
W = W₀ + ΔW, where ΔW = BA

Here, B ∈ ℝ^(d×r) and A ∈ ℝ^(r×k) are low-rank matrices, where r << min(d,k) is the rank of the adaptation. The rank r is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between adaptation capacity and computational efficiency.

**Implementation Details**
In our implementation, we apply LoRA to all linear layers in the transformer architecture, including:
- Query, Key, and Value projection matrices in attention layers
- Output projection matrices in attention layers
- Feed-forward network matrices
- Layer normalization parameters (optional)

**Advantages of LoRA**
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces memory usage by 60-80% compared to full fine-tuning
- **Training Speed**: Faster convergence due to fewer parameters and gradients
- **Model Sharing**: Enables efficient sharing of base models with multiple task-specific adapters
- **Stability**: More stable training process with reduced risk of catastrophic forgetting

### 3.4.2.2 LoRA Configuration and Hyperparameters

**Rank Selection Strategy**
The choice of LoRA rank (r) is crucial for balancing adaptation capacity with computational efficiency. Based on empirical studies and our specific requirements, we employ the following rank configurations:

- **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct**: r = 8, providing sufficient adaptation capacity while maintaining efficiency
- **GPT-OSS-20B**: r = 16, leveraging the larger model's capacity for more extensive adaptation
- **InternLM2.5-7B-Chat**: r = 8, optimized for conversational AI applications

**Alpha Parameter Optimization**
The alpha parameter (α) controls the scaling of LoRA updates. We set α = 4r for all models, following the established practice that α should be proportional to the rank. This configuration ensures stable training and optimal adaptation.

**Target Module Selection**
We implement LoRA on all linear layers (`target_modules = "all-linear"`) to maximize adaptation capacity. This comprehensive approach ensures that the model can effectively adapt to psychological counseling tasks across all architectural components.

## 3.4.3 Supervised Fine-tuning Implementation

### 3.4.3.1 Dataset Preparation and Formatting

**ShareGPT Format Implementation**
Our fine-tuning dataset follows the ShareGPT format, which provides a structured approach to conversational data. Each training sample consists of:

```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "from": "human",
      "value": "User input or question"
    },
